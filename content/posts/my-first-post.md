## hi,

**i am harshvardhan maurya. And this is my first post.**

<!--more-->

the fact that this post is here means that this site works! i will only have to continue making blogs and such since most of the work is done.

this place is definitely little bit empty but. maybe I will find a way to fill it bit by bit.😁

what am i currently doing? a lot! but for now i'm focusing on academics. i'm daily driving arch linux which is definitely working as it is

i'm interested in cybersecurity. i still haven't decided which field but i'm just exploring different fronts for now.

- also learning a lot of skills and languages which is necessary to make things work together, like python or bash.

i have a lot of to-do's to add things in this website but that's it for today, i'll maybe work on it later

that's it for today. i'll be posting either weekly or monthly.

thank you. 😊
